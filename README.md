# etch-a-sketch

As part of The Odin Project, this shoudl build on and test skills and knowledge gained in the curriculum so far. Specifically, there will be a an emphasis on combining HTML, CSS and Javascript.

From my projects so far, it is clear I will need to work on design/UI once the fundamentals are grasped. While I understand how to position and style elements, the look and feel is not something that coes naturally.

The logic of this project was not something that was too difficult at the time. The trickier parts were around setting a default grid, and ensuring the script loads at the correct times e.g. onload vs defer. This took a bit of trial and error as well as practicing going through and debugging (using console.log).
